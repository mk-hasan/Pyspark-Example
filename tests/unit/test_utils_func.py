"""
The simple unit test class, This class can be used to do the unit testing with the function written in transform class to help the transform fucntions.
The possible unit testing in current scenario:
1. Nothing here, if we had some helper function which does not require Sparksession then we can do unit testing. Everything in
this app requires integration testing.


We can check each non sparksession related function separately just like normal python unit test.
